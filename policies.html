                        <p>The European Union has introduced the Joint Clinical Assessment (JCA) to harmonize the evaluation of innovative health technologies, including recombinant vaccines, across all 27 member states. This centralized process replaces multiple national assessments, reducing duplication, improving efficiency, and facilitating faster and more equitable patient access. The JCA‚Äôs coordinated, evidence-based review is particularly important for recombinant vaccines, which are safer, scalable, and critical in addressing public health challenges such as COVID-19. MediQuills supports the implementation of the JCA and recommends targeted improvements, including structured consultations with biotechnology companies, equal voting representation for all member states, early engagement with clinicians, multilingual accessibility, systematic patient feedback, digital collaboration tools, and youth-focused public health education. Effective implementation of these measures could establish the JCA as a global benchmark for advancing healthcare innovation and equity. Click the button to see the full policy.

                        <h2>Feedback on the EU‚Äôs Critical Medicines Act</h2>
                        <p>The European Union‚Äôs Critical Medicines Act (CMA), effective in 2025, is a comprehensive framework aimed at strengthening pharmaceutical resilience, streamlining supply chains, and ensuring equitable access to essential medicines across all 27 EU member states. Prompted by vulnerabilities revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, and global supply disruptions, the CMA establishes a centralized list of over 300 critical medicines, including recombinant vaccines, and introduces coordinated procurement, stockpiling, and regulatory oversight to prevent shortages. Recombinant vaccines are recognized as critical due to their role in pandemic response, routine immunization, and disease-specific applications such as HPV, hepatitis B, and meningococcal vaccines, which faced frequent production delays during COVID-19 due to limited global suppliers. To address these challenges, the CMA centralizes regulatory processes, promotes investment in manufacturing capacity, diversifies supply, and encourages data-driven forecasting. Key recommendations include regularly updating the critical medicines list, establishing tiered risk-based prioritization, supporting sustainable vaccine manufacturing, creating a federated EU biofoundry network, and implementing a Recombinant Vaccine Stress-Test Program (REVAST). These measures aim to safeguard public health, reduce dependence on foreign production, and position the EU as a global leader in sustainable and resilient pharmaceutical policy.

                        <h2>Feedback on the EU‚Äôs Biotech Act</h2>
                   <p>The European Union‚Äôs Biotech Act, enacted in 2025, is a strategic initiative aimed at revitalizing Europe‚Äôs biotechnology sector, enhancing innovation, and supporting the development of recombinant vaccines. Despite Europe‚Äôs strong research institutions, private sector investment in biotech has lagged behind global competitors, limiting the region‚Äôs commercial and scientific advancement. The Biotech Act seeks to accelerate innovation by streamlining regulatory approval, expanding funding, strengthening biomanufacturing, and building a skilled workforce, particularly to advance recombinant DNA and mRNA vaccine technologies. Recombinant vaccines offer faster, safer, and more adaptable alternatives to traditional vaccine production, addressing public health needs while minimizing risks for immunocompromised populations. Key recommendations include dedicated funding for recombinant vaccine platforms, expedited regulatory pathways with risk-tiered assessment, flexible modular manufacturing frameworks, proportional biosafety and GMO regulations, incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises, long-term public-private partnerships, and specialized talent and training programs. Implementing these measures is expected to strengthen Europe‚Äôs biotech infrastructure, enhance public health through accelerated vaccine development, and position the EU as a global leader in biotechnology and pharmaceutical innovation.</p>

                        <h2> Feedback on the EU‚Äôs Health Technology Assessment - Joint Clinical Assessments of Medical Devices Initiative</h2>
                        <p>The European Union‚Äôs Joint Clinical Assessments (JCA), established under the 2025 Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Regulation, aims to harmonize clinical evaluation of medical devices, including recombinant vaccines, across member states. By reducing duplicative assessments, streamlining approval processes, and promoting equitable access, the JCA initiative enhances patient care and accelerates public health preparedness. Recombinant vaccines, which are safer, scalable, and more adaptable than traditional vaccines, benefit from the collective, evidence-based framework provided by JCAs, preventing delays and regulatory inconsistencies. MediQuills recommends seven measures to strengthen the JCA process, including structured member state consultations, balanced voting structures, clinician input for PICO development, linguistic and cultural accessibility, rapid patient feedback surveys, a digital collaboration platform, and public-facing educational initiatives for the future healthcare workforce. These recommendations ensure transparency, inclusivity, and scientific rigor while supporting innovation and equitable access to life-saving medical devices. Implemented effectively, JCAs can serve as a cornerstone of Europe‚Äôs leadership in medical innovation and healthcare equity.

                        <h2> Feedback on the EU‚Äôs Medical Devices - Establishment of an Expert Panel on Orphan and Paediatric Devices Initiative</h2>
                        <p>The European Commission‚Äôs establishment of an expert panel on orphan and pediatric medical devices represents a pivotal effort to address unmet needs in children with rare and complex diseases. MediQuills emphasizes the integration of recombinant biotechnology into pediatric device development, as recombinant proteins, enzymes, and antibodies can be embedded into biologic-device hybrids to enable safer, precise, and non-invasive treatments. Recombinant devices have demonstrated efficacy in conditions such as congenital hemophilia, lysosomal storage disorders, and growth hormone deficiencies, improving dosing accuracy, patient adherence, and neurological outcomes. MediQuills proposes seven key recommendations: promote integration of recombinant biologics into device development, create dedicated streams for biotech-enabled pediatric devices, update pediatric risk-benefit frameworks, fund biomanufacturing platforms for device-compatible components, establish a pediatric-biotech regulatory advisory council, encourage cross-sector collaboration, and ensure ethical inclusion of children in clinical trials. If implemented, these measures can enhance innovation, equitable access, and the effectiveness of pediatric and orphan disease treatments across Europe.
