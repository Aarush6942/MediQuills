                    <h3>Vaccine Policy Initiative</h3>
                    <p>Our Vaccine Policy Initiative is a youth-powered, science-driven movement reimagining the future of immunization through bold policy change. At the intersection of public health, advocacy, and equity, we are committed to fighting misinformation, improving vaccine access, and ensuring that lifesaving science reaches every corner of the world.</p>
                    
                    <p>We've published 4 official policy papers with the European Union, tackling urgent issues ranging from global vaccine equity to youth-led pandemic preparedness. Our work translates complex scientific data into actionable, people-centered policy—and proves that young people belong in the rooms where decisions are made.</p>
                    
                    <p>With a reach of over 10,000 individuals globally, we combine original research, youth consultation, and expert collaboration to create a platform where science meets strategy, and voices often left out of public health policy are finally heard.</p>
