We thoroughly enjoyed this well-structured book, which kept my kids 8 and 11 year old engaged throughout.
It sparked our kids' interest in science and human body, making complex concepts fun and easy to understand.
The activity section has hands-on approach and interactive content encourages curiosity and a deeper love for learning about the human body.
Kudos to the young author for writing and publishing the series.

The thing I liked about this book is, it has so many details on different parts of the brain and how they behave when you dream! Even though it is marked for kids of ages 6 to 12yrs, I would highly recommend this book for any age group who haven’t researched on dreams! Very well written!

This is a fun and easy-to-understand book that teaches children about the human body. It explains how different parts of our body, like the heart, brain, muscles, and lungs, work in simple language.

The book includes colorful pictures and diagrams that help kids see how their body functions. It’s full of interesting facts that make learning about the body exciting. The explanations are clear and easy for children to follow, making it a great way to introduce them to science.

Overall, this book is a great book for kids who want to learn more about how their body works. It’s educational and engaging. My 8 year old loved it.                    </blockquote>
